Clément works at siliceum, a company he co-founded, where he helps his clients to reach their performance goals. Previously working in the games and embedded industries, he acquired hands-on knowledge on optimizations while releasing titles such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. With more than 8 years of a love-hate relationship with C++ and no fear of legacy code-bases, he also likes reverse-engineering old games in his spare-time.
